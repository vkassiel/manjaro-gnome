# Hello!

To install the necessary packages and extensions, simply run `sh install.sh`. If you want to use gnome-extensions, you will need to install them manually. The `/manually/gnome-extensions/main.sh` folder contains all extension names.

Always check your gnome shell version compatibility with packages and extensions. My version during the writing of this markdown was `45.2`.

To setup git, change variables inside file `/develop/git/main.sh`.
